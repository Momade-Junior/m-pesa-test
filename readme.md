# Test for mpesa API

Demo app for prof of concept of future mpesa payments gateway API

This was written in about 6  hours and a few more of polishing afterwards so, it follows a basic structure and should be of easy understanding

## ATTENTION:

- This is only for refference. The Gateway for payments is innacessible outside of vodacom's LAN so the app shouldn't be functional unless vodacom opens it to public.

- For any improvements/ questions/ recommendation, please create an issue or open a PR

## INSTALLATION

- run `npm install`

- start application with either `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`
